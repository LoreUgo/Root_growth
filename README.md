# Root_growth
Calculating root growth and estimating the depth at which at least 90% of the roots are found

The first step is to calculate the root growth using a logit function. In the logit function, we can find k, which is a constant for speed growth that can be modified, and t, which is the time we think will be necessary for allowing the root to reach R_max (the maximum possible depth reached by roots). R_max can also be modified.

The second step is to calculate the cumulative root distribution in the soil. In most of the tree species, it is common that 90 % of root activity is located between 40 and 50 cm.
